# MatchTope
MatchTope is a tool developed for predicting peptide similarity, which can trigger cross-reactivity events, by computing and analyzing the electrostatic potentials of pMHC complexes.

# Requirements:
Python 3.7 version or higher
R version 3.6.3 or higher
pvclust (R package) version 2.2-0 or higher
Pymol version 2.5.2 or higher
Modeled pMHC or crystal files

# How to run:
Put your pdb files into the PDBs folder. It already has three files, for example, if you want to test the tool.
In your terminal, run bash run_pipsa.sh.
When it finishes, it will generate a pdf file called Results.pdf in the same folder of run_pipsa.sh.
